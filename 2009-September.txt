Message-ID: <4AB24ACB.4090101@swansea.ac.uk>


Hi All,

As I probably mentioned to you last week, I think the refactoring is 
difficult to progress without trying it out with the code (as opposed to 
talking it through with diagrams). Accordingly, I've created a branch so 
I can experiment, here:

http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/glimmer-cism/glimmer-cism2/branches/GCISM2-refactor-ICR

Of course, please feel free to look at what I get up to, or contribute 
to this branch, and/or create your own branches for the same purpose. 
When/if I have something I feel that might work, I'll let you know.

Cheers,

Ian

P.S. While I remember - Jesse, could you please send out Joomla! logins? 
Thanks!
